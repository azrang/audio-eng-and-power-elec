The objective of this project was to design the pre-amp stage for an amplifier. It should include two gain stages with a tone control circuit. The first stage should serve as the input buffer, so that the guitar input is isolated from the amplifier. After the first stage comes the tone control, which add tunable adjustments to hearing the Bass, Mid, and Treble. The second stage provides additional amplification after some is lost through the passive filters in the tone control. Overall, the output should exhibit about a 10V peak-to-peak.
