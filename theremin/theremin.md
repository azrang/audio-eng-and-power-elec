Invented in 1919 by a physicist from Russia, Leon Theremin introduced an instrument to the world that was able to be played without being physically touched by the musician. Named after its inventor, the Theremin relied on the electromagnetic field around its two antennas to be played. One antenna was responsible for the pitch of the sound while the other was responsible for its volume levels. By standing next to the antennas, the user is able create a capacitance between the antennas and themselves. By bringing their hands to and from the antennas, the capacitance is changed, which then results in various pitches and volumes. While it did not reach success after being patented, the Theremin found itself being used by musicians and featured in numerous films.
While the standard Theremin uses two antennas, the Theremin that was built for this project relied on one antenna that controlled the pitch of the sound. Instead of using a second antenna, an amplifier provided the ability to adjust the volume that was heard from the speakers. By only using one antenna, the Theremin became easier to operate since it only needed one hand to play.

This is the circuit that was built in lab and tested with the antenna and hand to control pitch:
